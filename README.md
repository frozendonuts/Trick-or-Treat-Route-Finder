# Trick-or-Treat-Route-Finder

Users (probably kids) will give reviews to houses in the neighborhood based on how much and what types of candy they give out on Halloween. Then the program will find houses that will net the user the most amount of candy that they want. The program then finds the quickest route to visit all of the houses and return home. It displays a map with the houses and routes highlighted, along withe directions in text.

Running the python file will generate a html file which can be opened to show what a webpage for this application looks like
